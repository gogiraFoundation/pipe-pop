# Naming Update Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to standardize the naming convention in the Pipe Network PoP Node codebase.

## Changes Made

1. **Service File**: Updated `pipe-pop.service` to use the correct script name (`start_pipe_pop.sh`).

2. **Management Script**: Updated the `pop` script to use consistent "pipe-pop" naming instead of "PPN" in comments and output messages.

3. **Start Script**: Updated `start_ppn.sh` to use consistent "pipe-pop" naming and ensured `start_pipe_pop.sh` symlink points to it.

4. **Run Node Script**: Updated `run_node.sh` to use consistent "pipe-pop" naming and updated log file naming.

5. **Backup Script**: Updated `backup.sh` to use consistent "pipe-pop" naming in comments and output messages.

6. **Naming Convention Documentation**: Created `NAMING_CONVENTION.md` to document the official naming convention.

7. **Automatic Naming Update Script**: Created `update_naming.sh` to automatically update all remaining references to "PPN" in the codebase.

## Naming Convention

The official name for the node binary and service is now consistently **pipe-pop** throughout the codebase:

- Binary name: `pipe-pop`
- Service name: `pipe-pop.service`
- Start script: `start_pipe_pop.sh`
- Repository references: "pipe-pop"

The user-facing command remains `pop` for simplicity and convenience.

## Benefits of Standardization

1. **Consistency with Upstream**: Aligns with the official naming used by the Pipe Network project.

2. **Reduced Confusion**: Eliminates confusion between "PPN" and "pipe-pop" references.

3. **Easier Maintenance**: Makes it easier to maintain and update the codebase.

4. **Better Documentation**: Provides clear documentation on the naming convention.

## Next Steps

1. **Review Automated Changes**: Review the changes made by the `update_naming.sh` script to ensure they are correct.

2. **Remove Backup Files**: After verification, remove the backup files created by the script.

3. **Update External References**: Update any external references to the node (documentation, websites, etc.).

4. **Restart Service**: Restart the service to ensure all changes take effect.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart pipe-pop.service
```
