# 🚀 Building a User-Friendly Pipe Network PoP Node

> **Version**: 1.0.0  
> **Last Updated**: March 3, 2024  
> **Status**: Production-Ready Implementation

## 🌟 Introduction

The Pipe Network is a decentralized content delivery network (CDN) that relies on distributed Points of Presence (PoP) nodes to deliver content efficiently across the globe. Our implementation, now known as pipe-pop, simplifies the process of running a Pipe Network PoP node, making it accessible to a wider audience.

Traditional CDNs come with high costs and centralized infrastructure. The Pipe Network offers an innovative alternative: a decentralized CDN powered by individual Points of Presence (PoP) nodes operated by users worldwide.

At Preterag, we recognized this technology's potential to revolutionize how Surrealine content reaches users globally. We've created a system that makes running a Pipe Network PoP simple and accessible for everyone.

## 🔭 Our Vision: Democratizing Content Delivery

We aimed to create a system allowing anyone, regardless of technical expertise, to set up and maintain a pipe-pop to:

1. 🌐 **Expand the Pipe Network's global reach** by increasing node count
2. ⚡ **Improve Surrealine content delivery** through geographically distributed nodes
3. 💰 **Create opportunities for node operators** to earn rewards
4. 🔄 **Democratize CDN infrastructure** by moving away from centralized solutions
